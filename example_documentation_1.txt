/*
 * This file is part of the Copilot Workshop Demo.
 *
 * In this example, we demonstrate how to use GitHub Copilot to generate documentation comments.
 * GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps developers by suggesting code snippets,
 * comments, and documentation based on the context of the code being written.
 *
 * To use GitHub Copilot, simply start typing your code or comment, and Copilot will provide suggestions
 * that you can accept, reject, or modify. This can significantly speed up the development process and
 * improve code quality by ensuring consistent and comprehensive documentation.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * 1. Start typing a function or a comment.
 * 2. Observe the suggestions provided by Copilot.
 * 3. Accept a suggestion by pressing `Tab` or modify it as needed.
 *
 * Note: Ensure that you review and edit the suggestions to fit your specific use case and coding standards.
