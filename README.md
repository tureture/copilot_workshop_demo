# ü§ñ GitHub Copilot Demo

This guide will walk you through a simple demonstration of GitHub Copilot, your AI programming assistant.

## üõ† Getting Started

1. Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
2. Choose one of the two tasks and let Copilot guide you.
    - In Task 1 you convert a string of roman integers to a number.
    - In Task 2 you determine if the parenthesis in a string are valid or not.
    - Both tasks are in Python (but note that Copilot works for many more programming languages!)
3. Run the Python file to verify your code. If all tests pass, your solution is correct!

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- **Open Copilot Chat:** Click the chat icon in the VSCode sidebar to open Copilot Chat.
- **Accept Suggestions:** Press `Tab` to accept an inline code suggestion, similar to how regular code completion tools work.
- **Inline Chat:** Press `Ctrl + I` to open inline chat with Copilot.
- **Code Suggestions:** Press `Ctrl + Enter` to choose between multiple code suggestions.
- **Command Line Assistance:** Copilot can assist you in the command line interface (terminal) as well.
- **Contextual Assistance:** You can drag and drop files into the chat to provide relevant context, or let Copilot automatically decide which files to consider.

## üîç Things to Try

- **Problem Summarization:** Ask Copilot to summarize the problem for you.
- **Code Explanation:** Have Copilot explain specific parts of the code.
- **Inline Copilot:** Use Copilot inside a file or in the terminal with `Ctrl + I`.
- **Expand Unit Tests:** Try expanding or improving the provided unit tests with Copilot's help.
- **Type Hints:** Let Copilot help you add type hints to the code.
- **Documentation** Let Copilot write docstrings and comments making the code more readable.

## What's Next? üöÄ
- **Apply for Copilot:** Follow the instructions in the PowerPoint! We will also send out instructions after the workshop, if needed.
- **Try it on real coding problems:** Copilot shines even more when applied to real coding tasks. Try it out on your own projects and evaluate how well Copilot integrates with your workflow.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- üêç Python installed
- üñ• Visual Studio Code (or another IDE that supports Copilot)
- üë§ A GitHub account with Copilot access
